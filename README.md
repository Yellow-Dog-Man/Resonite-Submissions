2. Using the Dev Tool, select and navigate to the root of your object in the inspector.
3. After selecting the root slot of what you are adding the thumbnail to in the inspector, click to add a new component with the attach component on the bottom.
4. Once the component attacher menu pops up, navigate to the **Uncategorized** category, under that category find the **[ItemTextureThumbnailSource](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:ItemTextureThumbnailSource)** component. All components are listed in alphabetical order. and double click the component in the list.
5. Drag and drop the image into the image field by either grabbing the image and clicking the field with either hand or have your laser pointed at the field and let go of the image.
6. You can also click the bottom most button of the thumbnail component to ensure there is one thumbnail used for the submission.
