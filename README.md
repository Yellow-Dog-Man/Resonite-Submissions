This GitHub repository is for submitting content to be included in the Resonite Essentials "Community Shared Folders" section.

Content is submitted as shared folder links. You can find instructions for getting a link to a folder below.
## Submission Guidelines:

1. Submitted content must not break our user guidelines or terms of service:
2. You must be the creator of the content or have the rights to share the content under one of our acceptable licenses. Acceptable licenses are CC0 or CC-BY.
3. Items must include their licensing in an obvious way.

Submitted content must be under these licenses: CC0(public-domain), or CC BY 4.0 (Must include Attribution within the asset and folder). This includes content that you have made on your own that you are submitting.

Note: You may need to check the licensing/terms of assets from their sources as some licenses/terms may NOT allow specific content to be redistributed or modified at all.

Content made with any Resonite default assets doesn't require additional attribution on-platform.

Every submission will be reviewed, vetted, and organized into a folder within the main Resonite Essentials folder named "Community Shared Folders"

If there are any issues with your submission we will leave feedback on your submission to allow you to correct it.

Any feedback regarding your submission should be sent via this GitHub.

You can also obtain the folder URL by selecting a spawned shared folder using a dev-tool and inspecting the inventory link component.

Pasting folder URL links into Resonite will spawn the shared folder connected to that URL and can be saved into the inventory like any other object.
